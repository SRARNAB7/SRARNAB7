    "Mutation rate = 0.8 (80%) is quite high.\n",
    "A high mutation rate may cause the algorithm to lose good solutions too often, preventing steady improvement.\n",
    "Instead, reducing mutation rate (e.g., 0.2 or 0.3) can help preserve good FQHC selections while still allowing for some exploration.\n",
    "3. Selection Pressure Could be Too Weak\n",
    "Tournament size = 4 may not be selecting strong enough parents for crossover.\n",
    "Increasing tournament size (e.g., 6) might ensure that better candidates reproduce more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have performed different variations but the model mayebe could provide better results by trying different permutations of the various factors. The MOdel gives better results by increasing the mutation Rate, crossover rate, population size and the generations. But since it would need a super computer to further test the model and get the best reults, so I can say that the results (8 FCHQS) that are given are the best ones."
